JENKINS NOTES


1️⃣ Jenkins Basics
Key Topics
✅ What is Jenkins? Why use it?
What is Jenkins?
"Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to automate the software development process, primarily for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). It runs jobs, builds code, runs tests, and deploys applications based on defined pipelines."

Why use it?
"We use Jenkins to save time by automating repetitive tasks, catch bugs early with CI, and streamline deployments with CD. It’s highly customizable with plugins, scalable with agents, and free, making it ideal for improving efficiency and reliability in development workflows."

✅ Difference between Jenkins Freestyle and Jenkins Pipeline
     Freestyle jobs are simple ui based  basic configurations but  jenkins pipeline is script based.   jenkins pipeline is highly customisable by freestyle is not .
     error handling option is available in  pipeline based jenkins
✅ How does Jenkins integrate with Git, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible?
 
Git	Git Plugin, Webhooks, git command
Maven	Maven Plugin, mvn command
Docker	Docker Plugin, Build & Push images
Kubernetes	Kubernetes Plugin, Deploy apps with kubectl
Ansible	Ansible Plugin, Run playbooks for configuration management

Sample Questions
🔹 What are the key features of Jenkins?
🔹 How does Jenkins achieve continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)?
🔹 How do you configure a GitHub webhook to trigger a Jenkins job?

2️⃣ Jenkins Pipelines (Declarative & Scripted)
Key Topics
✅ Difference between Declarative and Scripted Pipelines
✅ Pipeline stages: Agent, Stage, Steps, Post, Environment
✅ Shared Libraries & Reusable Pipelines

Sample Questions
🔹 Write a simple Declarative Pipeline to build and deploy a Java app.
🔹 What is the difference between node {} and agent any in a pipeline?
🔹 How do you pass parameters between pipeline stages?

3️⃣ Jenkins Plugins & Integrations
Key Topics
✅ Common plugins: Pipeline, Git, SonarQube, JUnit, Docker, Kubernetes
✅ How Jenkins integrates with Ansible, Terraform, AWS, Kubernetes
✅ Managing Jenkins plugins from CLI

Sample Questions
🔹 How do you install plugins in Jenkins via CLI?
🔹 How does Jenkins integrate with Docker/Kubernetes for containerized deployments?
🔹 What is the role of the Blue Ocean plugin?

4️⃣ Jenkins Job Types & Scheduling
Key Topics
✅ Freestyle Jobs vs Pipeline Jobs
✅ Parameterized Builds and Multibranch Pipelines
✅ Scheduling jobs using cron expressions

Sample Questions
🔹 How do you trigger a Jenkins job using a cron expression?
🔹 What is a Multibranch Pipeline, and why is it useful?
🔹 How do you configure a parameterized build?

5️⃣ Jenkins Distributed Builds (Master-Agent Setup)
Key Topics
✅ Difference between Master and Agent nodes
✅ Configuring Jenkins Agents (SSH, JNLP, Docker-based agents)
✅ Load balancing and high availability

Sample Questions
🔹 How do you add an agent node to a Jenkins master?
🔹 What are the different ways to connect Jenkins Agents?
🔹 How do you distribute builds across multiple agents?

6️⃣ Jenkins Security & Performance
Key Topics
✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
✅ Securing Jenkins with LDAP, SSH, API Tokens
✅ Best practices for Jenkins performance tuning

Sample Questions
🔹 How do you secure Jenkins from unauthorized access?
🔹 What are some best practices for Jenkins performance optimization?
🔹 How do you troubleshoot a slow Jenkins pipeline?

7️⃣ Jenkins & DevOps (Real-World Scenarios)
Key Topics
✅ Implementing Blue-Green & Canary Deployments
✅ Automating infrastructure with Jenkins + Ansible/Terraform
✅ Deploying applications to AWS, Kubernetes (EKS), Docker Swarm

Scenario-Based Questions
🔹 How would you set up a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices app?
🔹 How do you rollback a failed deployment in Jenkins?
🔹 What steps would you take if a pipeline fails midway?

🛠️ Hands-On Practice (Important for Interviews)
✅ Build a Jenkins Pipeline for a Java/Maven Project

✅ Integrate Jenkins with GitHub, Docker, Ansible, AWS, Kubernetes

✅ Set up a Jenkins Agent in Docker
